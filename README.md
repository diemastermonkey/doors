# doors
A clever self-contained Python3 procedural generation "dungeon crawl" demo. Generates game state on-the-fly, stores player state inside itself. User commands are kept as "inline metadata". Seemingly persistent enemies, locations, and keys are all procedurally generated. Combat, event schedules, and items are in the works. 

# Use
Intended to be called once per command, so I can later hook it up to a remote channel (chat room, etc).

# Example run
